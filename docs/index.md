#DISCLAIMER

_This project should be used for research purposes only. The purpose of the project is to show the potential of Artificial Intelligence for medical support systems such as diagnostic systems._

_Although the model is accurate and shows good results both on paper and in real world testing, it is trained on a small amount of data and needs to be trained on larger datasets to really evaluate it's accuracy._

_Developers that have contributed to this repository have experience in using Artificial Intelligence for detecting certain types of cancer. They are not doctors, medical or cancer experts._
